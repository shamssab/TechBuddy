        the language of everything presented on your phone. Here’s how to do it:

      <Text style={styles.instructionText}>
        1) Go to your settings. (There is a link on the bottom of this page that
        will take you to your settings)
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.instructionText}>
        2) Go to Preferences, then Languages. (If you don’t see preferences, you
        may use the search icon in your Settings app to search “Languages”)
      </Text>
      <img src={SettingsPicture} alt="Search Image" />
      <Text style={styles.instructionText}>
        3) There should be a “Your Selected Language” option, and it will be set
        to English. There should also be a “Select Language” option. Tap that
        button.
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.instructionText}>
        4) A list of languages should appear, scroll through until you find the
        one you want.
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.instructionText}>
        5) Some settings will ask you to verify that you want to change to the
        selected language. Make sure to select “Yes” or your changes will not be
        saved.
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.instructionText}>
        Below is a button which will directly lead you to your languages option
        on your settings. Tap it to immediately get to your settings.
